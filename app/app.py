ATTENTION_MAJOR_SWEEP_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""Run the broadest possible private Daily Flow Attention Major sweep now. Treat this as equal to or broader than the full Daily Flow vision, not a narrow approval check.

Start by posting status='in_progress' to /api/jobs/{{jobId}} with a concise status pulse that says Major is running a broad sweep across Daily Flow app state, Outlook email, Inbox calendar invites, calendar/schedule, Teams signals, WorkIQ/research context, drafts/results, blockers, meetings to prepare for today/tomorrow, and impact highlights.

Required signal sources and what to look for:
1. Daily Flow app state: GET /api/state?view=agent (the lean projection built for automations; never the default /api/state, which carries the full completed-job and event history and costs many times more to read). Inspect pending approvals, activeJobs, Major chat threads needing replies, todayActivity, impactLedgerSummary, and stale or failed work. Use GET /api/impact-ledger when you genuinely need the full body-of-work history, and GET /api/activity-log for the full event log.
2. Major chat and employee-work jobs: process queued dashboard-chat/employee-work jobs. Route internally only to configured employees and report all visible progress/results back through Major in the same thread.
3. RSVP jobs: execute only dashboard-approved calendar-rsvp jobs exactly as instructed. Keep RSVP comments blank or generic. After a successful accept RSVP, delete only the handled invite email from Inbox.
4. Outlook Inbox email signals: scan recent Inbox email for urgent/high-importance messages, unread messages that look actionable, customer/client requests, explicit asks, deadlines, promised follow-ups, attachments needing review, and messages that require a reply, research, scheduling, or content creation. FIRST classify each Inbox message as either a plain email or a calendar/meeting message, and route them differently. A message is a calendar/meeting message when its Graph type is an event message (message['@odata.type'] contains 'eventMessage', or meetingMessageType is set such as meetingRequest/meetingCancelled/meetingAccepted/meetingTentativelyAccepted/meetingDeclined), or its messageClass starts with 'IPM.Schedule', or it carries Exchange meeting headers (X-MS-Exchange-Calendar-Originator-Id, EE_MeetingMessage). Time-off / status blocks sent as appointments (subjects like 'Emily DTO', 'Sarah OOF', 'Raj PTO', 'Out of Office', invitation/cancellation/updated subjects) are calendar messages, NOT email. Route every calendar/meeting message to /api/inbox-invites (see item 5); never POST it as sourceType='email'. Only route genuine non-meeting email to /api/review-signals. For every actionable plain email, POST /api/review-signals with sourceType='email', subject, sender/from, receivedAt, sourceId (the Outlook/Graph message id), sourceUrl (the email's Graph webLink so the user can open the original in Outlook), importance, isRead, hasAttachments, signalType, priority, summary, and recommendation. When available also include messageClass and meetingMessageType so the server can verify the classification. Evidence-based lifecycle: cards no longer disappear just because a later sweep omits them, so you must signal resolution explicitly. When you have fully enumerated actionable Inbox email this sweep, POST that batch with reconcile=true, coveredTypes=["email"], and completeSnapshot=true so any email card whose sourceId is no longer present is treated as handled-at-source and retired. If you cannot guarantee a complete enumeration, instead pass resolvedIds=[sourceId,...] listing only the specific emails you confirmed were deleted/handled, and omit completeSnapshot. Never rely on omission alone to clear a card. Create private drafts/tasks/approvals as appropriate; do not send externally. Do not classify explicit asks such as "do you have instructions", "can you send", "please review", "need by", or "follow up" as non-actionable. If the user rejects an email approval, queue deletion of that exact email only.
5. Inbox calendar invites: the Outlook Inbox is the single source of truth for calendar approval cards. Enumerate current Inbox messages, read headers for every message, classify only Exchange/Outlook meeting evidence, match each confirmed invite to the real calendar event, extract date/time/location/organizer/showAs/response status, check same-day conflicts, and POST decision-grade cards to /api/inbox-invites. Include sourceUrl (the event's Graph webLink, or the invite message webLink) on each invite so the user can open the original. Always POST the COMPLETE current set of Inbox-resident invites in a single call with completeSnapshot=true (the default) so the backend retires any calendar card whose invite is no longer in the Inbox. If there are zero invites in the Inbox right now, still POST {{"invites": [], "completeSnapshot": true}} so all stale calendar cards are cleared. Never post weak placeholders, and never skip the POST just because the Inbox has no invites.
6. Calendar and schedule: proactively identify anything the user should know about, with special priority on meetings to prepare for today and the next day. Check today's and tomorrow's calendar for customer/executive/external meetings, prep-heavy meetings, meetings with missing context, dense blocks, direct conflicts, tentative/unanswered items, OOF blocks, no-buffer risks, and meetings that imply follow-up or content prep. For each prep gap that needs a decision or artifact, POST /api/review-signals with sourceType='meeting-prep' so it appears in Approval inbox rather than being buried in a sweep summary.
7. Teams/chat signals: always inspect recent Teams messages directed at the user: 1:1 chats, direct @mentions, messages naming the user, replies to the user, direct asks in group/meeting chats, and messages requesting the user's response, review, decision, or follow-up. Then scan other relevant Teams chats/messages for decisions, blockers, promised follow-ups, customer/account context, and items that should become a Daily Flow task, draft, approval, or research handoff. Treat directed Teams messages as high-priority "you should know" candidates unless clearly FYI/no-action. For every important directed Teams item, POST /api/review-signals with sourceType='teams', subject/title, sender/from, receivedAt, sourceId/chatId/messageId, sourceUrl (the Teams message webUrl deep link so the user can open the original chat), signalType, priority, summary, and recommendation so it appears in the Approval inbox or Major's sweep summary instead of being buried. Teams cards are NOT exhaustively enumerable, so never post completeSnapshot for teams; to clear a Teams card after the user has replied/handled it, pass resolvedIds=[sourceId,...] for that exact message. Do not message anyone else without approval.
8. Meeting/action context: look for open meeting action items, follow-up commitments, prep briefs needed, decisions from recent meetings, and artifacts requested for upcoming meetings today or tomorrow.
9. Research/WorkIQ context: check open research threads or recent work context relevant to active jobs, upcoming meetings, customer requests, drafts, and proposals. Route useful findings to Riley or Dash and cite/source them in private results.
10. Drafts/results/documents: inspect completed work for missing or stale result links, drafts needing review, docs/decks that should be surfaced in Results, and artifacts that need to be saved under {ONEDRIVE_DOCUMENT_ROOT}.
11. Dashboard/work-ledger health: update private events, result summaries, approval cards, blocked work, today's activity log, and concise work-ledger entries so the cockpit changes as soon as useful information is found.
12. Body-of-work capture: when actual work is completed or discovered, POST /api/work-ledger with brief entries for meetings the user actively participated in, documents/decks/briefs/drafts/artifacts created, meaningful internal or customer collaboration, people worked with, customer/account context, research applied to work, and completed follow-up work. Write entries as the user's accomplishments, not employee actions: say "Created..." or "Prepared...", never "Drew created..." or "Mina accepted...". Capture who the work was for with people/customer/account context whenever available. Keep entries leadership-ready, bullet-friendly, and much shorter than Activity Log entries. Include impactSummary/impactLevel only when the item also meets the impact definition; do not inflate routine work into impact. Do not capture low-value internal scheduling/RSVP cleanup unless it is tied to a customer/executive/partner meeting worth reporting. When the work is about OTHERS adopting, enabling, or replicating the Dream Team / Scout (colleagues onboarded, workshops or how-to sessions delivered, mentoring, shared IP, cross-org demand or inbound interest), set category to 'adoption', 'enablement', or 'mentoring' and include the people/customer/org so it feeds the Adoption Ripple view.
13. Additional Approval inbox workflow candidates: create /api/review-signals cards for meeting prep gaps (sourceType='meeting-prep'), follow-up commitments (sourceType='commitment'), blocked employee work (sourceType='blocked-work'), outbound drafts ready for review (sourceType='outbound-draft'), customer research opportunities (sourceType='research'), daily impact highlight candidates (sourceType='impact-highlight'), and stale thread nudges (sourceType='stale-thread'). Only create impact-highlight candidates for outcomes that moved the needle for Microsoft, customer/business results, measurable influence, shipped/adopted work, risk removed with clear business value, or letters/messages of gratitude. Do not treat scans, approvals queued, work organized, or monitoring as impact. If there is no meaningful outcome, create no impact card, but still capture actual completed work in /api/work-ledger. Do not create cards for CRM update proposals, file/share risk, or document/deck quality issues.

Rules:
- Approval-inbox lifecycle is evidence-based. A pending card is removed ONLY when the user acts on it in the app, when you confirm the source was handled (resolvedIds, or a completeSnapshot enumeration where its sourceId is gone), or when a calendar invite / meeting-prep card passes its meeting end time (auto-expired by the server). Never expect a card to vanish merely because a sweep did not re-list it, and never omit an item to make it disappear.
- One card per item. Do not create multiple Approval-inbox cards for the same email, Teams message, or meeting. Reuse a stable sourceId for the underlying item (the Graph message/event id, or for meeting-prep the calendar event id) and a consistent subject so repeat sweeps update the existing card instead of spawning near-duplicates. The server also de-duplicates by subject as a safety net, but do not rely on it.
- CARDINAL OUTPUT RULE: {CARDINAL_OUTPUT_RULE}
- Honor each employee's trust level and Always-Do / Ask-First / Never-Do protocol shown in the TEAM TRUST + PROTOCOL block at the end of these instructions. Skip any employee marked PAUSED. An employee may only do unattended work its trust level and Always-Do permit; everything else needs an Ask-First approval card.
- Decision memory: do not re-surface an item the user already rejected, deferred, or handled (same sender + subject/source) unless its content materially changed. The server also suppresses known-dismissed items as a safety net.
- Civilians (parallel one-off workers): when a request splits into many independent one-off tasks (e.g., research 4 vendors at once, draft 3 variants, read 5 files in parallel), you may spin up throwaway "civilians" by POSTing /api/civilians {{title, count, instructions}}, then report each civilian's result back via /api/jobs/{{jobId}}. Civilians are unnamed, dissolve when done, and follow the CARDINAL OUTPUT RULE — results go to the user only.
- Keep all work private/internal. Do not send, publish, share, contact others, write CRM, or modify/delete/move/archive data except the specifically allowed handled accepted invite email cleanup, exact rejected-email cleanup, and exact approved-email cleanup after a reviewable Outlook draft exists.
- Do not invent progress or employees. Use only configured Daily Flow employees.
- Convert signals into real outcomes: approval cards, queued work, private drafts/artifacts, progress updates, blocker reports, work-ledger entries, accepted impact highlights, or completed results.
- Mark the sweep completed only after app state is refreshed, queued work/RSVP jobs are addressed or explicitly left active with status, live invite count is verified, and the dashboard has a useful outcome summary.
